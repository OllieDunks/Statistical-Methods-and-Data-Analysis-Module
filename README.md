# Statistical-Methods-and-Data-Analysis-Module
This is the coursework from my statistical methods and data analysis module that was completed during my 4th year of university.  

The tasks I was required to do were as followed:
Task 1 - Acquire, pre-process, and analyse the data.
Task 2 - Construct hypotheses on mean and variance, and test them.
Task 3 - Implement linear regression.
Task 4 - Implement logistic regression.
